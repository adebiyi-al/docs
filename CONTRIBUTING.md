## Platform

Frontity uses [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) to generate the [documentation site](https://docs.frontity.org/) which is connected to our docs repositories 

Docs Site | Repository | Description
---------|----------|---------
 [docs.frontity.org](https://docs.frontity.org) | https://github.com/frontity/docs | Introduction, concepts and guides

Every time the `master` branch of each repo is updated the whole documentation site is rebuild

This docs repositories are the "source of truth" for Frontity's documentation and any suggested changes are managed through [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (to its [`master`](https://github.com/frontity/docs/tree/master) branch).

 
## Documentation Format

The documents in the different docs repositories use [**Markdown syntax**](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown) to add format and structure to the texts.

> - https://commonmark.org/help/
> - https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
> - https://markdown-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html

These Markdown documents are [used by gitbook](#platform) to generate the final HTML you can see in our [documentation site](https://docs.frontity.org/).

## Contributions Workflows

To suggest changes in Frontity's documentation **you'll need a GitHub account** (so create it if you don't have already one)

There are several workflows you can use to suggest changes.
All of them finish with the creation of a Pull Request.

> If you want to know more about Pull Requests you can take a look at:
> - [📑 "Opening a pull request" | opensource.guide ](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request)
> - [📺 How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub | egghead.io ](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

Your changes will not be visible right away, the maintainers of the framework will first review them and then merge them if the suggested changes are approved.
So you don't need to worry about breaking anything!

Here you have the most important workflows you can use to suggest changes in Frontity's documentation:

#### • [`Edit on Github`](https://github.com/frontity/docs/wiki/Edit-on-Github)  📝 <a name="Edit-on-Github" />

This workflow is recommended for minor changes in just one file and for those who have little or no experience with git or github.
With this workflow you can edit documentation directly online in your browser.

Learn more about this workflow [here](https://github.com/frontity/docs/wiki/Edit-on-Github).

#### • [`Fork & Edit on Github`](https://github.com/frontity/docs/wiki/Fork-&-Edit-on-Github) 📝📝 <a name="Fork-&-Edit-on-Github" />

This workflow is recommended for changes in several files and for those who have some experience with git or github
With this workflow you can also edit documentation directly online in your browser.

Learn more about this workflow [here](https://github.com/frontity/docs/wiki/Fork-&-Edit-on-Github).

#### • [`Fork, Local Edit & Push`](https://github.com/frontity/docs/wiki/Fork-&-Local-Edit-&-Push)  📝📝📝 <a name="Fork-&-Local-Edit-&-Push" />

If you are familiar with Git, you can use the `Fork, Local Edit & Push` workflow.
This, in fact, is the preferred method for all but very minor changes.
If you've previously contributed to other projects on GitHub via pull requests, you should already be familiar with this workflow.

Learn more about this workflow [here](https://github.com/frontity/docs/wiki/Fork-&-Local-Edit-&-Push).

> For minor changes, or if you're new to GitHub, we suggest that you use the `Edit on Github` workflow, because it's a quick and easy way to make changes. 

> If you have knowledge of Git and/or your proposed changes are more extensive then we recommend that you use `Fork, Local Edit & Push`.
