{% endhint %}

Let's kick things off by providing you with a roadmap so that you can find your way around the documentation and zero in on the information you need right now.

## **About Frontity**

To learn about what Frontity is, how it works, and what features it has, visit the
[**About Frontity**](about/) section.

If you're a **developer** this section will tell you all about what Frontity is capable of and what you can do with it.

If you're a **project manager** or other **decision maker** that needs to choose or justify whether to use Frontity for your project then this section provides the information you need.

## **Getting Started**

If you're new to Frontity then you can get started by heading over to, erm..., the [**Getting Started**](getting-started/) section.

This is where you'll find our [**Quick Start Guide**](getting-started/quick-start-guide.md) that will get you up and running with Frontity quickly. In particular we would like to draw your attention to the [**Initial checks**](https://docs.frontity.org/getting-started#initial-checks) section. Make sure you read this <ins>before</ins> running the installer.

Once you've followed the Quick Start Guide and have a working Frontity installation we'll show you how to [**connect Frontity up to your own WordPress site**](getting-started/connecting-to-wordpress.md) and also how to customise the menu to reflect the structure of your WordPress site.

## **CLI Commands**

If you've followed our Getting Started section then you've already used the Frontity CLI to create your first Frontity project. The [**CLI Commands**](frontity-cli/) section is a reference guide to all the other CLI commands that you can use and that can help you during the life-cycle of your project.

## **Core Concepts**

This section is the heart of our documentation. Once you've nailed the basics in the Getting Started section you should head over to the [**Core Concepts**](learning-frontity/) section to really dig in to the detail and learn how to work with Frontity.

## **Architecture and Deployment**

Find out about how the relationship between Frontity and WordPress is structured in the [**Architecture**](architecture.md/) section. This section will also tell you more about possible hosting solutions.

## **Deployment**

Once you've completed the development of your project and have a working application that you're happy with you can learn how to deploy to live in the [**Deployment**](deployment/) section.

In particular we go into detail on how to [**deploy to Vercel**](deployment/deploy-using-vercel.mdgit /), our recommended hosting platform. Why do we recommend it? Because it's serverless, cheap, includes a CDN, and is really easy to set up.

## **Packages**

Frontity comes with a number of useful packages for routing, API source, and so on. You can learn all about each of them in the section entitled [**Packages**](api-reference-1/).

## **Themes**

Really **everything** is a package when you're working with Frontity.

However a Frontity theme is a special instance of a Frontity package. The included themes, namely Mars and TwentyTwenty, are therefore dealt with separately from the other packages under the [**Themes**](frontity-themes/) section.

## **WordPress Plugins**

The team at Frontity are working on some WordPress plugins that you can install and activate in your WordPress installation. These will help you make the most of headless/decoupled WordPress by adding some useful functionality to the backend.

Learn about the growing list of plugins that can help both enhance your site and make your development easier in the [**WordPress Plugins**](frontity-plugins/) section.

## **Guides**

This is where you'll find an ever-growing series of [**Guides**](guides/). Some will help you in working with Frontity. Others will give you ideas for projects and provide you with the help you need to guide you from first steps to fully working project.

This is where you can really have fun with Frontity and work toward your stretch goals.

In this section we also provide you with some foundational knowledge that will assist you when working with Frontity. So if you need a refresher, or if you're new to the topics, we have included introductions to JavaScript/ES6 and React in this section.

Our troubleshooting guide is also here, for when you encounter problems. If your problem is not solved here then don't forget that you can also ask it in our [**Community Forum**](https://community.frontity.org).


## **Contributing**

Frontity is an open source project and we welcome contributions from the community. The [**Contributing**](contributing/) section of the documentation will guide you whether you want to make a single contribution or whether you intend to become a fully fledged contributor to the Frontity project.
