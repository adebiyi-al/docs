# üèó Architecture

In Frontity projects, WordPress is used as a [headless CMS](https://css-tricks.com/what-is-a-headless-cms/) and _Frontity uses the WP REST-API to generate the final HTML_ that is displayed in the browser. This means that WordPress is merely used for managing the content.

Frontity runs a Node.js web server while WordPress requires a PHP server to work.

Taking this into account, there are two main **Frontity Modes** (architectures or configurations), recommended for Frontity projects:

- [Decoupled mode](decoupled-mode.md)
- [Embedded mode](embedded-mode.md)

Both of these architectures will require **two different servers** with **two different URLs** but the communication workflow between these two servers is different in each case

## Servers and Domains distribution

A Frontity project will always require two servers:

- A **WordPress Server (PHP)**
  - Apache or Nginx web server running PHP
  - Hosted software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform with WordPress such as WordPress.com
- A **Frontity Server (Node.js)**
  - Server running Node.js
  - Hosted function-as-a-service (FaaS) platform allowing serverless computing such as AWS Lambda or Netlify functions


Depending on the mode, the **primary domain** will be connected to the Wordpress/PHP Server (Embedded) or to the Frontity/Node.js server (Decoupled). The primary domain is the one used by users to access the HTML of the site.

The other server will get a secondary role and its domain can be either a separate domain or a sub-domain of the primary domain.

## Overview of Frontity Modes

Any Frontity architecture (Decoupled or Embedded Mode) features:

- A _similar distribution of functionality across the servers_
  - WordPress is used as a CMS - to manage the content
  - Frontity is responsible for the presentation

- A _similar operation_
  - Frontity fetches the data from the WordPress REST API
  - Frontity generates the final HTML

Implementing a cache strategy in Frontity projects is highly recommended to improve response times. A [WordPress Cache plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-cache/) is especially recommended to cache REST API requests in both architectures. 
{% endhint %}

### Decoupled Mode

**[Decoupled mode](decoupled-mode.md)** uses two different domains. The main one ([www.domain.com](http://www.domain.com/)) for Frontity (Node.js server) and a subdomain ([wp.domain.com](http://wp.domain.com/)) for WordPress (PHP server).

In this mode site visitors access the site using the primary domain and are served HTML pages directly from Frontity, and the secondary domain is used by content editors to access the WordPress admin pages. Frontity fetches data from the REST API located on the secondary domain, i.e. the WordPress installation.

{% hint style="info" %}
Decoupled mode needs no additional structural elements, such as plugins.
{% endhint %}

Due to the two-domains nature of this mode, it‚Äôs the mode where developers need to be aware, test, and take care of most things:

- URL replacements from¬†[wp.domain.com](http://wp.domain.com/)¬†to¬†[www.domain.com](http://www.domain.com/).
- Cross-domain 301 redirections from Frontity to WordPress and vice-versa.
- 301 redirections of individual URLs stored in the WordPress database.
- Proxying WordPress resources that need to be served from the¬†[www.domain.com](http://www.domain.com/)¬†domain.
- Adding CORS headers in the¬†[wp.domain.com](http://wp.domain.com/)¬†domain.
- Purging page cache of the¬†[www.domain.com](http://www.domain.com/)¬†domain.

It‚Äôs also the mode where, due again to the two-domains nature, it‚Äôs impossible to make it 100% transparent for the content editors because it‚Äôs not possible to:

- Render the admin bar for logged in users.
- Make 100% transparent post previews.

**Key ideas** in Decoupled Mode:
- It uses two domains, one for WordPress and another for Frontity.
- The main domain ([www.domain.com](http://www.domain.com/)) points to Frontity.
- A subdomain ([wp.domain.com](http://wp.domain.com/)) points to WordPress.


### Embedded Mode

In **[Embedded mode](embedded-mode.md)** the primary domain points to the WordPress installation, and the secondary domain points to the node.js server running Frontity. In this mode both site visitors and content editors use the same domain, i.e. the primary domain, to either visit the site or access the admin pages. The secondary domain is never directly accessed.

Embedded mode requires the [Frontity Embedded Mode plugin](https://api.frontity.org/frontity-plugins/embedded-mode). This plugin uses a configuration setting that identifies the location of the Frontity server. The plugin replaces the WordPress theme with its own template file which fetches the HTML from the Frontity server. However, before Frontity can deliver the HTML it must request the content from the WordPress REST API.

Since, in embedded mode, the Frontity site is never directly accessed the secondary domain can be anything - including free domains allocated by the node.js hosting service.

**Key ideas** in Embedded Mode:
- A single domain is used for both WordPress and Frontity.
- The main domain ([www.domain.com](http://www.domain.com/)) points to WordPress.
- All the requests are handled by WordPress. No reverse proxy is needed.
- The PHP theme is replaced with an internal HTTP request to the Frontity server.
- The rest of WordPress URLs work normally.

### Differences

Despite the above similarities there are significant differences between the two architectures.


Whereas [a WordPress cache](https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/best-wordpress-caching-plugins/) is recommended in either architecture, because of the two way data flow in Embedded mode [an additional cache for the REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rest-cache/) is very highly recommended.


Furthermore, since in decoupled mode site visitors do not access the WordPress site directly a wordpress.com site with a your-site.wordpress.com type of address can be used if it's sufficient for your purposes. More complex backends may require a self-hosted wordpress.org site.
