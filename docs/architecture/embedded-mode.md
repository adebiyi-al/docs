# Embedded Mode


### Hosting

### Domains

Requires the [Frontity embedded mode plugin](https://api.frontity.org/frontity-plugins/embedded-mode).

Requires self-hosted wordpress.org based site.

Slower execution - Frontity requests the data from WP's REST API and returns the HTML to WordPress which serves it to the browser
  - two data transfers
	- cache required (both normal and REST caches recommended)




## Advantages of Embedded Mode


## Considerations to take into account

REST API cache strongly recommended
