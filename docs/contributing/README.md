## Why to contribute?

As you may know, Frontity is an open source project, available and free for everyone. We believe that working in an open, collaborative way and sharing knowledge has the power to change the world for the better.

Here are some good reasons to contribute to open source:

* **Connects you with people:** an open source community usually consists of people sharing similar interests, so it will allow to connect with amazing people.
* **Improve your skills and competences:** if you are looking to practice, there is always a task for you in open source projects. This will allow you improve your knowledge.
* **Learn from mentors and share your thoughts:** it is an incredible way to share and get expertise, and it is really refreshing.
* **Get recognition**: all your work is public so you can get more visibility and recognition from others. Apart from that, you are in the perfect spot to learn about forthcoming changes.
* **Your work matters**: you are able to make changes to a project - see how your improvements help others it is pretty gratifying.

These are only a few reasons, but that there are many more.
