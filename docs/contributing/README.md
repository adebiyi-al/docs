## Why to contribute?

As you may know, Frontity is open source, available and free for everyone.

We believe that **open source** is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. It allows everyone to do things that otherwise they couldn't. Beside this, we believe that **collaboration** leads to a better development of technology.

Other reasons to contribute to open source? There are plenty of them:

- **👥 Connects you with people:** an open source community usually consists of people sharing similar interests, so it will let you meet amazing people.
- **💪 Improve your skills and competences:** if you are looking to practice, there is always a task for you in open source projects. This will allow you improve your knowledge.
- **🎓 Learn from mentors and share your thoughts:** it is an incredible way to share and get expertise, and it is really refreshing.
- **🔝 Get recognition**: all your work is public so you can get more visibility and recognition from others. Apart from that, you are in the perfect spot to learn about forthcoming changes.
- **👏 Your work matters**: you are able to make changes on a project - see how your improvements help others it is pretty gratifying.

These are only some of the reasons, but we are aware that there are many more. We'd love to hear about your experience with open source projects, feel free to share it in [the community](https://community.frontity.org/c/community) or with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/frontity)!
