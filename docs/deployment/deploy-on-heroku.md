# Deploy Frontity on Heroku

To be able to deploy with now you need to have a Heroku account. You can [signup here](https://signup.heroku.com/).

You will also need to install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up)

> The Heroku CLI requires Git, the popular version control system. If you donâ€™t already have Git installed, complete the following before proceeding: [Git installation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) & [First-time Git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

Once you have an account and the Heroku CLI installed you have to login from the terminal 

```text
> heroku login
```

---

These are the instructions to deploy a Frontity project on Heroku, once you are ready to deploy your project:

### Create a [heroku app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app)

Create an app on Heroku from the root of your project

```text
> heroku create
```

Heroku generates a random name for your app (`shielded-gorge-51896` in the example), or you can pass a parameter to specify your own app name.

```text
â¬¢  my-frontity-project î‚  master â¦¾ heroku create
 â€º   Warning: heroku update available from 7.25.0 to 7.38.2.
Creating app... done, â¬¢ shielded-gorge-51896
https://shielded-gorge-51896.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/shielded-gorge-51896.git
```

When you create an app, a git remote (called `heroku`) is also created and associated with your local git repository.

```
â¬¢  my-frontity-project î‚  master â¦¾ git remote -v
heroku	https://git.heroku.com/shielded-gorge-51896.git (fetch)
heroku	https://git.heroku.com/shielded-gorge-51896.git (push)
origin	git@github.com:frontity-demos/my-frontity-project.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:frontity-demos/my-frontity-project.git (push)
```

### Add a `start` script

Heroku will execute automatically the content of your `start` script so add the following one to your `scripts` section in your main `package.json`

```
"scripts": {
  "start": "frontity serve --port $PORT",
  "dev": "frontity dev",
  "build": "frontity build",
  "serve": "frontity serve"
},
```

Heroku will execute automatically the content of your `build` script before starting your app. You should have this one already defined.


> Notice how we're using $PORT to take this value from an environment variable. This is done in this way because Heroku will set a different port for each process and that port will be stored in a `PORT` environment variable

### Deploy

The way to deploy to Heroku is pushing to the `heroku` git server, so we can do

```text
git heroku master
```

You should get something like this 

```sh
â¬¢  my-frontity-project î‚  master â¦¾ git push heroku master

*Heroku* will assign you a domain (something like *your-project-name.herokuapp.com*) that will allow you to check your site online

---

## Deploy a production site

To [deploy your site under a custom domain in Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains) you have to...

- add your custom domain in your Heroku app
- add proper record in your domain provider so the DNS communication is properly done

...before deploying it


### Add your custom domain in your Heroku app

With the command `heroku domains:add` you can add a specific custom domain in your Hereku app

for example by doing:

```
heroku domains:add heroku domains:add www.variables-demo.com
```

you should get something like this
```
â¬¢  my-frontity-project î‚  master â¦¾ heroku domains:add www.variables-demo.com
 â€º   Warning: heroku update available from 7.25.0 to 7.38.2.
Adding www.variables-demo.com to â¬¢ shielded-gorge-51896... done
 â–¸    Configure your app's DNS provider to point to the DNS Target damp-whale-rln632baq4jdhcj5aw495bst.herokudns.com.
 â–¸    For help, see https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains

The domain www.variables-demo.com has been enqueued for addition
 â–¸    Run heroku domains:wait 'www.variables-demo.com' to wait for completion
```

### Add a [`CNAME`](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains) in your domain DNS settings

Once you have added your domain to your Heroku app you can use the command `heroku domains` to see the value for the `CNAME` record you have to set in your domain settings

```
â¬¢  my-frontity-project î‚  master â¦¾ heroku domains
 â€º   Warning: heroku update available from 7.25.0 to 7.38.2.
=== shielded-gorge-51896 Heroku Domain
shielded-gorge-51896.herokuapp.com

=== shielded-gorge-51896 Custom Domains
Domain Name             DNS Record Type  DNS Target
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
www.variables-demo.com  CNAME            damp-whale-rln632baq4jdhcj5aw495bst.herokudns.com
```


With this info you can [add a CNAME](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains) in your domain DNS settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't know how to do this, contact your domain provider (GoDaddy, CloudFlare, etc)
{% endhint %}

### Deploy

Then, deploy Frontity using this command (from the root of your project):

```text
> git heroku master
```

> If no changes are detected you may have to do:
> `npx frontity build` â†’ to generate a new build
> `git commit --allow-empty` â†’ to force a empty commit
> `git push heroku master` â†’ to push this lateste build into heroku and launch its deploy process
