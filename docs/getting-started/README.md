# ðŸš€ Getting started

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! You've just taken your first step on the path to mastering Frontity.

Frontity is a **React-based framework** that enables you to easily build a frontend for a headless \(or decoupled\) WordPress site. Your WordPress site serves its data via the REST-API. Frontity framework is open source and free to use.

## Requirements

To get started with Frontity you will need:

### A WordPress installation

By default Frontity provides an [example WordPress site](https://test.frontity.org/) as the data source for every new project, so for this Quick Start Guide we will work with this.

You can also [configure your own WordPress installation](quick-start-guide.md#set-your-own-wordpress-installation) to be the data source. This can be hosted either locally on your development machine, or on a web-server. You can also use a site hosted on wordpress.com.

### Node.js

If you don't already have it you can get *Node.js* from [the official site](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install `npm` and `npx` along with Node.js.

You will use these to run Frontity commands during the set-up and development of your project.


{% hint style="info" %}
For those coming from WordPress it might be worth noting that *Frontity* runs on **Node.js**, so it needs to be deployed in a different server than your WordPress. If you want to learn more about this, visit our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/frontity/frontity#why-a-different-nodejs-server) or see the [Architecture](../architecture.md) section arch these docs.

To test if you have Node.js installed open your terminal and run:

```bash
node -v
```

```bash
npm -v
```

## Get up and running
