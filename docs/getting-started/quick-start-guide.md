# Quick start guide

Right, let's get you set up with your very first Frontity project. This guide will take you from the very basics to feeling amazed at what you can do with Frontity!

> Please check that you meet the [**requirements**](README.md#requirements) before following the steps below.

## Getting started with Frontity

1 - **Create a new Frontity project** by entering the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npx frontity create my-first-frontity-project
```

2 - **Select a starter theme**. If it's your first time using Frontity we recommend that you select `@frontity/mars-theme` to start with.

```
? Pick a starter theme to clone: @frontity/mars-theme (recommended)
```

A directory with the same name as the project name you used will be created. It will have a structure similar to this:

```text
my-first-frontity-project/
|__ node_modules/
|__ package.json
|__ frontity.settings.js
|__ favicon.ico
|__ packages/
    |__ mars-theme/
```

3 - **Run the project locally** by executing this command from the terminal:

```sh
cd my-first-frontity-project && npx frontity dev
```

A development server will be started. This server will be listening on http://localhost:3000 and watching for any changes inside the packages directory.

4 - Now youâ€™re **ready to make changes** to your site

Open the project directory in your preferred code editor/IDE and try editing some of the files under `packages/mars-theme`. Each time you save a change the browser will automatically reload and display the new version as these changes are detected by the development server.

5 - **Set your own WordPress installation** as the source of data

You can connect your own WordPress site to your Frontity project by setting the `state.source.url` property in the `frontity.settings.js` file.

```javascript
const settings = {
  ...,
  packages: [
    ...,
    {
      name: "@frontity/wp-source",
      state: {
        source: {
          // Change this url to point to your WordPress site.
          url: "https://test.frontity.org/"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Check the guide [**Setting the URL of the WordPress data source**](https://docs.frontity.org/guides/setting-url-wordpress-source-data) to learn more about how to properly set the URL of the WordPress data source taking into account the different WordPress scenarios
{% endhint %}

By default, `state.source.url` is set to `https://test.frontity.org/` (our demo WordPress site) but you can set this property to any valid URL pointing to a WordPress site.

Your site at `http://localhost:3000` won't auto-update with this change as auto-updates only occur with changes to files in the packages directory, so you will need to manually refresh the page in your browser.

You should now see your own posts in the Frontity project displayed in the browser.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you use your own WordPress installation take into account you need to use one of the pretty permalinks options, rather than the plain one, in `Settings->Permalinks`.
