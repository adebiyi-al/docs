## Getting started with Frontity

1.-  **Create a new Frontity project** by using the Frontity CLI with a single command:

```text
npx frontity create my-first-frontity-project
```

2.-  **Select a starter theme**. We recommend you to start with `@frontity/mars-theme`

```
? Pick a starter theme to clone: @frontity/mars-theme (recommended)
```

A folder with your project name will be created with some files inside of it

```
my-first-frontity-project/
|__ node_modules/
|__ package.json
|__ frontity.settings.js
|__ favicon.ico
|__ packages/
    |__ mars-theme/
```

3- **Run the project locally** by doing

```
cd my-first-frontity-project && npx frontity dev
```

A development server will be started. This server will be listening to http://localhost:3000 and watching for any changes inside the packages folder.


4- Now youâ€™re **ready to make changes** to your site

Try editing the files under `packages/mars-theme` and save your changes. The browser will automatically reload when these changes are detected

5- **Set your own WordPress installation** as the source of data 

You can connect your own WordPress site to your Frontity project by setting the `state.source.url` property in the `frontity.settings.js` file

```javascript
const settings = {
  ...,
  packages: [
    ...,
    {
      name: "@frontity/wp-source",
      state: {
        source: {
          // Change this url to point to your WordPress site.
          url: "https://test.frontity.org/"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

By default, `state.source.url` is set to `https://test.frontity.org/` (our demo WordPress site) but you can set this property to any valid URL pointing to a WordPress site

Your site at `http://localhost:3000` won't auto-update with this change as auto-updates only occur with changes to files in the packages folder, so you will need to manually refresh the page in your browser.

You should now see your own posts in the Frontity project displayed in the browser.
