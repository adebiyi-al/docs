# ðŸ‘Œ SEO

Frontity allows you to optimize the SEO performance of your site and customize how your site is indexed by search engine crawlers.

By default, Frontity will deliver to your browser a fully populated and well-formed [HTML file generated from your React code](architecture.md). This reduces the time required for the first contentful paint and ensures a good SEO score.

But that's not all. With Frontity you can also customize:

* Meta tags 
* `robots.txt`

## Header meta tags

You can include the meta tags generated by your WordPress SEO plugin in your React app so they can be properly rendered in the  section of the final HTML

In order to do that you use:

* The [REST API - Head Tags](https://api.frontity.org/frontity-plugins/rest-api-head-tags) **WordPress plugin**. This plugin has been developed by the Frontity team and it adds the meta tags generated by your WordPress SEO plugin to the REST API
* The [@frontity/head-tags](https://api.frontity.org/frontity-packages/features-packages/head-tags) **Frontity package**. This package is designed to automatically get all the data that the REST API Head Tags plugin exposes in the REST API

## `robots.txt`

A [`robots.txt`](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608) file tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler should or shouldn't request from your site.

You can add the `robots.txt` file at the root of your theme \(next to the `frontity.settings.js` file\) and when you build and deploy your app for production, it will be automatically picked up by the Frontity server and served at `https://your-site-url.xyx/robots.txt`.

You can also [check out our example](https://github.com/frontity/frontity/blob/1460e7c03ce3600f4f8ece0d6cf8fadb2bf9b526/examples/mars-theme-example/robots.txt) of a theme that is using a `robots.txt` file.
