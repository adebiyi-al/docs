# Application Architecture

With Frontity you can structure your application using these two main architectures:

* [Direct to Frontity](possible-architectures.md#direct-to-frontity)
* [PHP Theme Bridge](possible-architectures.md#php-theme-bridge) ![COMING SOON]

We strongly recommend the "**Direct to Frontity**" approach as it matches most user's needs, but we are developing new options in case it doesn't fit yours.

Before choosing this solution, you may want to check out our recommendations about selecting a server, your domains and the cache technique at "[Decisions you should take](./#decisions-you-should-take)".
{% endhint %}

### Direct to Frontity

With this architecture, WordPress is used as a headless CMS and we use Frontity to generate and show the final HTML. This means that WordPress is used just for managing the content.

* Frontity uses the WP API to retrieve content and generate the final HTML.
* Frontity is also able to generate AMP pages with the same React code and CSS.

This solution requires a PHP Server for WordPress and a Node Server for Frontity, as well as a new domain for your WordPress site as the main one will be used by Frontity.

| **‚úÖ Pros** | ‚ùå **Cons** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Perfect fit for users with free WP.com blogs \(myblog.wordpress.com\). | Users need to change their WordPress domain. |
| Fastest server side rendering \(no useless WordPress request needed\). | A Frontity server is needed. |
|  | The server side rendering is still slow if the WordPress site is slow, so it may need a cache layer on top. |

### PHP Theme Bridge ![COMING SOON]

{% hint style="warning" %}
üõ† We're still working on this solution (but it's a priority for us). [Feel free to ask](https://community.frontity.org/c/framework) any questions you might have.
{% endhint %}

This is a PHP theme that doesn‚Äôt generate any HTML. Instead, it does an HTTP call to the Frontity server to retrieve the HTML and outputs that.

With this solution, you won't need a new domain for your WordPress site, but you will still need a PHP Server for WordPress and a Node Server for Frontity.

| ‚úÖ **Pros** | ‚ùå **Cons** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Users don‚Äôt need to change their WordPress domain. | A Frontity server is needed. |
| The cache can be done with WordPress plugins, which know when to invalidate it intelligently. | There is more routing involved \(it goes to WordPress, then Frontity, then WordPress outputs the HTML\). |
|  | Users **must** use a cache plugin or it will be very slow. |
